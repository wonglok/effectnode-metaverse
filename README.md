# EffectNode Metaverse - a Boilerplate for You

![SkyCity Church](https://github.com/wonglok/effectnode-metaverse/raw/master/docs/landing.png)

Effect Node METAVERSE is a open source boilerplate project for helping everyone own their own metaverse.

The Vision for Effect Node Metaverse is that everyone should be able to own a piece of the whole metaverse cake over the internet. LokLok, the sole inventor of EffectNode, wants to embrace the hyperlink in the internet because it’s the fundamental of the internet that is letting users flow to different information with a breeze.

3D Content on the web has always been a high price / high cost for anyone who wants to own a piece of the metaverse cake. And by sharing the starter boilerplate, it made the metaverse open and to prevent a single ownership of the technology.

We all don’t really like having to pay a royalty fee to every creation that we yearn to make.

Effet Node is an on-going group of projects made by Lok Lok.

Open Source Custom Graphics Pipeline with Custom Shaders in web computer graphics is extremely rare in the market and is costly to many. And that is what effectnode is made for - to provide good and high quality code to people who wants to create 3D Content.

Effect Node has evolved throughout the years to improve the developer experience on building custom visual effects.

- 2014 Particle Simulation Animation with Raw WebGL APIs
- 2017 Shader Node (before effect node) - won $300K HKD Grant
- 2019 Effect Node - Webbys Nomination
- 2019 Effect Node - Webbys Judgeship
- 2021 Effect Node Cloud - Webbys Honoree

The sole inventor of Effect Node, Lok Lok, wants to share many of his expertise in webgl engineering, through this open source boilerplate
